+It uses aircrack-ng and MDK4 as an API to make random hotspots and fuzz your networks. It also allows to troll         +
+Tech Support scammers(shout-out to Malcolm Merlyn and Jim Browning). It has an user-friendly interface, with           +
+lots, I mean... Lots of easter eggs, so I suggest to poke around, or look at the code, to find some easter             +
+eggs, or bugs. If you found a bug, please, send over in an "Issue" tab. I'll try to fix bugs as soon as                +
