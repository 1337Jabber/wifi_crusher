WiFi Crusher. This is like-a LazyScript by Arios Mela Chronios, but with the feel of the Rapid7's metasploit-framework.
                                                                       

I am not responsible, for any misuse or abuse of this tool(pranks, making trouble for Point-On-Sale terminals, etc.) 
Since it's GNU, and redistrubited through GitHub(and/or any large repository), it comes with ABSOLUTLEY NO WARRANTY,  
to the extent by the applicable law.                                                                                   
                                                                                                                       
It uses aircrack-ng and MDK4 as an API to make random hotspots and fuzz your networks. It also allows to troll         
Tech Support scammers(shout-out to Malcolm Merlyn and Jim Browning). It has an user-friendly interface, with
lots, I mean... Lots of easter eggs, so I suggest to poke around, or look at the code, to find some easter             
eggs, or bugs. If you found a bug, please, send over in an "Issue" tab. I'll try to fix bugs as soon as                
possible.
